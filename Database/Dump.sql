This unique know-how enables MetaSensing to design products with on-demand specifications (like space mission demonstrators), or with features not yet commercially available from other competitors. All products are continuously subject to both incremental and radical improvements, placing them at the leading edge of the commercial market. Continuuously morphing knowledge into robust and reliable real-world radars, MetaSensing has manufactured airborne SAR systems at different frequencies (P, L, C, X, Ku, Ka) at multiple interferometric and polarimetric channels for virtually any known SAR application: land cover classification at L-band, forest biomass estimation and FOPEN at P-band, dual-frequency/tomographic imaging of ice and snow structure at Ku-X-band and Ku-L-band, X-band moving target indicators. In more recent years, the company has transcended the boundaries of airborne SAR to expand to ground-based SAR systems for deformation monitoring (FastGBSAR), solid-state, fully polarimetric weather radar systems at X and Ka bands, as well as ground-based military surveillance and tracking systems.

More importantly, it also scales those digital apps straight into production, whether on the Web or even on the Edge. Today, Interplay processes AI on Edge Computers in more than 3,000 locations. Nvidia, Google Cloud, and AWS are formal partners. AI and Digital software development are extremely fast because Interplay\'s engineers have prebuilt 475 software components; 43 of the 475 are AI enablers like Random Forest Classifiers. Interplay also includes >3,500 reusable components available from the dev community. Interplay is supported by a second proprietary product named Signals. Signals help executives make informed decisions, build digital solution roadmaps and architectures, and ensure Interplay\'s pre-built components are always best-of-breed.

It was the 10th state to be admitted to the Union on June 25, 1788. Home to approximately 8 million residents, Virginia is the 12th most populous state in the United States. The capital is Richmond, and its most populous city is Virginia Beach. The narrative history of the Commonwealth of Virginia often begins with the founding of Jamestown in 1607, near what is now modern day Williamsburg, Virginia. Jamestown became the first permanent English settlement in the New World, and the Virginia General Assembly, established on July 30, 1619, is now recognized as the oldest legislative body in the western hemisphere. When Virginia became a royal colony in 1624, the robust tobacco trade that had been developing in Virginia helped establish the American colonies as a powerful economic force. During the American Revolution, Virginia witnessed the final surrender of British forces at Yorktown and later became known as the birthplace of many revolution-era figures and future American presidents, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. To date, 8 United States presidents have been born in Virginia, more than in any other state. The modern government of Virginia is nearly identical in structure to the federal government, and is divided into 3 branches, these being the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. The Virginia General Assembly is comprised of the 100-member House of Delegates and the 40-member Senate. A governor and lieutenant governor are elected every 4 years. Governors cannot be elected to or serve consecutive terms. Virginia’s judicial system consists of the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the Circuit Courts, and the lower General District Courts and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts. Virginia has 13 electoral votes in presidential elections, and possesses 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nView Top Employees from Commonwealth of Virginia','http://www.virginia.gov','https://www.linkedin.com/company/virginia.gov/about','virginia.gov','https://www.industrial-transformation.com//content/dam/constellar-core/industrial-transformation/logo-content-fragment/images-2024/supporting-partners/AWS_Logo_Resized.png','yes'),('https://d1hbpr09pwz0sk.cloudfront.net/logo_url/eeoc-395ad248','aws','EEOC','sponsor','https://www.industrial-transformation.com/',NULL,'1463.0','(202) 663-4900',1965,'131 M Street, NE, Washington, D.C, District of Columbia 20507, US','Cities, Towns & Municipalities,  Government Administration,  Education,  Employment Law Enforcement,  Alternative Dispute Resolution,  Government,  Mediation - Alternative Dispute Resolution,  Human Resources,  Government and Military,  Training and Technical Assistance,  Technical Support,  Outreach and Education','EEOC Information\nEEOC | 19,821 followers on LinkedIn | Advancing EEO for all.

Surgeons certified by the ABS have completed at least five years of training following medical school and successfully completed a written and oral examination process administered by the ABS. They must then maintain their board certification through ongoing learning and assessment activities. Not all surgeons are board certified. Board certification by the ABS is a voluntary process that demonstrates a surgeon\'s commitment to lifelong learning and quality patient care. It recognizes individuals who have met ABS standards specifically in the area of general surgery and its related specialties. This is different from possessing a medical license, which is the minimum required by law to practice medicine and is not specialty specific. The ABS offers board certification in general surgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, and complex general surgical oncology. It is one of the 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.\nView Top Employees from American Board of Surgery','https://www.absurgery.org','https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-board-of-surgery/about','absurgery.org','https://architecturebuildingservices.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABS-2024-Poster_AO-722x1024.jpg','yes'),('https://d1hbpr09pwz0sk.cloudfront.net/logo_url/abs-group-75a2ee01','ABS','ABS Group','partner','https://architecturebuildingservices.com.sg/',280000000,'1536.0','(281) 673-2800',1971,'1701 City Plaza Drive, Spring, Texas 77373, US','Business Consulting and Services','ABS Consultants Information\nABS Consultants is a Software Development company based at 1701 City Plaza Dr, Spring, Texas 77389, US founded in Jan. 1, 1987, midnight.\nView Top Employees from ABS Consultants','http://www.abs-group.com','https://ao.linkedin.com/company/absgroup/about','abs-group.com','https://architecturebuildingservices.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABS-2024-Poster_AO-722x1024.jpg','yes'),('https://d1hbpr09pwz0sk.cloudfront.net/logo_url/starhub-16700ee0','STARHUB','StarHub','sponsor','https://architecturebuildingservices.com.sg/',1790000000,'1,001-5,000 employees','(656) 825-5000',2000,'67 Ubi Ave 1 05-01, Singapore, SG','Telecommunications','StarHub is a leading homegrown Singapore company that delivers world-class communications, entertainment and digital services.
